Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
	
	A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width.
	An inline element doesn't start on a new line and only takes up as much width as it can. I've had trouble with this in the past so i've had to use css to define how much a block element can with %.
	
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

	Once it's absoulte it will be like that for all browsers.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

	something like display: inline; or :block; and you'd give the width: a value of a % or px.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

	display block: <h1-h6> a list item <li> and a <blockquote>
	display inline: <a> and <img>
	display inline-block: <button> and <select>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 

	this is a tough one to explain myself, but the box model consists of content, padding, border and margin. these are the rules on all html elements and they're all different. If you wanted to modify them, you can use css to target each side of the box and it always goes clockwise to define which side you want to modify. so heres an example of what it would look like : margin: 0 auto 0 auto;
	yikes. i've done it before but it's hard for me to articulate. i do know the rules though.
